I am a tenured professor of mathematics at Ohlone College in Fremont, California.  My primary teaching interests are Statistics and Math for Liberal Arts.  This summer, I am working on developing 50/50 hybrid Intro to Statistics courses using the Carnegie Mellon University's Integrated Statistics Learning Environment (ISLE).  

My hobbies are being outdoors and playing games.  Walking and biking around the Quarry Lakes and Alameda Creek are my daily enjoyments.  Right now, the game I am enjoying is backgammon, you can find me playing online at [Backgammon Galaxy](www.backgammongalaxy.com) as **jricoii**.   Other games that I enjoy are cribbage and dominoes.  I hope to start a backgammon club at Ohlone College once we return to campus.
