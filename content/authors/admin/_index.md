I am a tenured professor at Ohlone College in Fremont, California.  My teaching interests are Statistics and Math for Liberal Arts.  This summer, I am working on developing 50/50 hybrid Intro to Statistics courses using the Carnegie Mellon University's Integrated Statistics Learning Environment (ISLE).  

My hobbies are being outdoors and playing games.  Right now the game I am enjoying is backgammon.  Other games that I enjoy are cribbage and dominoes.
