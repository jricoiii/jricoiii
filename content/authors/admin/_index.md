I am a tenured professor of mathematics at Ohlone College in Fremont, California.  My primary teaching interests are Statistics and Math for Liberal Arts.  This summer, I am working on developing 50/50 hybrid Intro to Statistics courses using the Carnegie Mellon University's Integrated Statistics Learning Environment (ISLE).  

My hobbies are being outdoors, playing games and listening to music.  Walking and biking around the Quarry Lakes and Alameda Creek are my daily outdoor enjoyments.  Right now, the game I am enjoying is backgammon, you can find me playing online at [Backgammon Galaxy](www.backgammongalaxy.com) as **jricoiii**.   I hope to start a backgammon club at Ohlone College once we return to campus. Other games that I enjoy are cribbage and dominoes. 

Regarding music, I am always interested in hearing new music.  My favorite musical genres are Reggae and Jazz.  Although lately, I am finding pleasure in diversifying my listening with more current pop music (mainly singer-songwriter).   My favorite musical events are jazz festivals.  I have been to festival is Montreal, San Jose, and Detroit.
