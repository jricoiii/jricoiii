![Bob Marley](/img/bob_2.jpg)

Reggae music for me, started with the sweet music of Bob Marley and Wailers.  It was a 6 album set by JAD of early Bob Marley and the Wailers 1967-72.  A few years later, a friend invited me to see the Wailers play - and it was awesome!

I still follow reggae music.  Luckily, there are some great reggae DJs keeping radio "Live!"  I also look forward to seeing live reggae, especially outdoor performances.
