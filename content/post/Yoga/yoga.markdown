I first went to a talk by an enlightened guru, Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev, when I was in graduate school at The University of Michigan.  I was motivated to take a 7 day yoga program taught by Sadhguru the following Spring.   It has been an amazing journey since spending my first week with Sadhguru.  I am very grateful for learning about yoga and the yoga practices continue to have a positive impact of my life.  If you are interested in yoga, I recommend looking at the following website,  [Isha Foundation](isha.sadhguru.org/us-en/isha-usa/)
