## Dominoes
I have learned to play on dominoes from my trips to Jamaica, Mexico and the Dominican Republic.  I love the fact that anyone can play and that everyone is welcome at the domino table.  The game is relatively simple (my favorite version is Block Dominoes with No Points), but you do become skilled in the power of observation and learning from what each player has played.  There are in fact good and bad domino players - often it just depends are they paying attention or not.  I like a fast paced game of dominoes and could really play everyday.  Just sit on the beach at a table and invite people over for game after game.  I would love to start a dominoes league - where we can meet, play dominoes and listen to roots reggae music!

### Tien Gow
I had been a domino player for some time.  One day, I was talking to Lou, a sweet man who owned a little convenience store in my apartment complex (Huron Towers) in Ann Arbor, MI.  Lou came from China, and somehow the conversation got around to what games he played in China - and he told me about Chinese Dominoes - I bought a set and he explained to me, his memories of playing Pai Gow.   He went on to tell me all about his life in pre and post Communist China.

Tien Gow is the original tile (domino) game from China.   Tien Gow is played with the same set of dominoes that are used in Pai Gow.  Pai Gow is a real fast game, Tien Gow is a little more strategic, sort of like a Chinese version of War.   Tien Gow also has the best name for a pair of dominoes, The Supreme Pair (Gee Joon).
