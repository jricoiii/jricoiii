I love to be outside in the mountains and forests.  Losing myself in their freedom and beauty fills me with gratitude and amazement.  Being outdoors uplifts my spirit and inspires me.     I haven't done much backpacking recently, last overnight backpacking was in bear country - Glacier National Park, Montana.  Before that a 2-nighter in Desolation Wilderness on Lake Tahoe's coast with a Summit of Mt Tallac.  My favorite hiking location around here is Big Basins near Santa Cruz.
