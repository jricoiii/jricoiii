## Description and Grading of Components  

### ISLE Modules
There are 7 ISLE modules that will serve as our main guides throughout the semester.  

To obtain full credit (12 points) for the module:  
- You need to attempt every question for 10 points
- If you don't complete the entire module, you will receive a proportion of 10 (e.g., 85% Completion Rate = 8.5 out of 10 points). You can see your percent complete by hovering over your name in the upper middle of the page.
- Provide reasonable, thoughtful responses to the questions. I will randomly choose "a representative question or two" that will be spot-checked for 2 points.

#### Format of the Modules
- **Page 1 - Learning Objectives**
  - provides focus, attention
- **Page 2 - Preparatory Work** (*Intake Information*)
  - provides facts, terminology, introduction to ideas/concepts, learning checks
- **Page 3 - Skill Demonstration** (*Intake Information*)
  - provides examples, demonstration of tool, guided practice
- **Page 4 - Group Discussion Prompts** (*Using Information, Building Skill*)
  - provides solo practice, reflection, discussion, modification, consultation 

### Group Discussion
In addition, each module will have a **Group Discussion Component** page that provides instructions on an particular analysis to complete and write a report.  You will construct your report using Google Slides and [embed the slideshow](https://blogs.acu.edu/adamscenter/2020/04/19/embed-a-google-slides-presentation-in-canvas/) into the Canvas discussion for that module. 


#### Discussion Guidelines
This discussion consists of three phases;

##### PHASE ONE :
Your own attempt (in the form of an embedded Google Slides) is due either Friday or Saturday. (depends on your section - check Canvas)

Details [here](https://ohlone.instructuremedia.com/embed/9991ac60-ecfb-4e09-a242-ed9f2075ad03) (go to end of video to see how to embed) -  

 

##### PHASE TWO:
As a group discuss your submissions and try to come to agreement on what your group wants to submit as a "final answer."  You can start this process as individual attempts are submitted.

 

##### PHASE THREE: 
A  group "final answer" submission is due the following week Tuesday or Wednesday at 10pm. (depends on your section - check Canvas)

 

##### GRADING:
You will get a grade for the discussion based on your participation and the correctness of the "final answers." To obtain full credit for the discussion;

- 5 pts for submitting your own attempt that is reasonable (3pts) and on time (2pts).
- 2 pts for thoughtful (1pt) participation (1pt) in the discussion.
- 3 pts for thoughtful/correctness/quality in the "final answer", everyone in the group gets these points.

#### Discussions Drive Improvement
As a result of your participation in the discussion space;
- You will be able notice and resolve discrepancies and inconsistencies in statistical analyses.
- Improve clarity in the reporting of an analysis.
- Improve accuracy in conducting the analysis.

And hopefully, during the discussion you are able to see errors in your work or a better way to explain your findings. If so, please make changes to your report and embed the modified report (***tip***: *make a copy of the initial report, otherwise the initial slide show will change and you will lose your original report*) under your initial post. We will be developing a portfolio that includes all of your works, so being diligent with an attitude towards continuous improvement of your reports will be of immense value when you work to clean up your portfolio for final submission at the conclusion of the semester.

### Team Members Assessment of You
About every 2-3 weeks, I will ask your team to assess (on a three point scale) your role as teammate in three categories;
- attendance
- participation
- supportive  

An additional 1 point can earned for outstanding recognition.  I will exclude the low and high rating and take an average of the remaining assessments.  

[Example of Assessment Form](https://forms.gle/d1e7Mpk1v9NVPsJt8)


### Quizzes
We will have 4 quizzes to test you on the skills being developed in the ISLE modules.  You will complete these outside of class on a given day.  (I will release the quiz in the morning and it will be due by the following morning).  The quiz will mainly be short answer and should take no longer than 1 hour.

### Projects
Each project will be worth 30 pts.  *Grading criteria for the project is still being developed. Details to be shared as soon as possible.*

### Article Presentation 
The week 9-10 article analysis mini-project will be worth 20 points.*Grading criteria for the mini-project is still being developed. Details to be shared as soon as possible.*

### Final Exam
The final exam will consist of three components; 
- analysis of brand new data set
- semester long portfolio of your work and reflections
- quality of failure essay

## Extra Credit Potential 
In an effort to encourage and rewards attendance and participation, I am trying something new this semester.  I will be tracking attendance and participation in whole class discussion.  You will gain 2 pt for each class session you attend.  You will gain 10 pt for each time you volunteer to share your screen.  You will gain 4 point for each question asked.  You will also gain 4 point for each question answered.  Can I keep track of this without going insane?  I don't know, but I'll give it a try and see.  

How does this translate into extra credit.  Well, let's try this.
- We have 29 classes for a possible 58 pts (I allow for 4 misses so - 50 points)
- You should be able to share your screen at least twice for 20 points.
- Hopefully, you can ask at least 5 questions and answer at least 5 questions - for 40 points.

Therefore, you should be able to obtain 110 points.  I will;
- subtract 100 from your points
- multiple remaining points by 0.1 and add that % at end of the semester boost to your grade.

For example, let's say you earn 130 points.  
- 130-100 = 30 pts
- 30*0.1 = 3% extra credit

Let's see if this is manageable, if not I'll try to find an easier way to reward you for your participation.
