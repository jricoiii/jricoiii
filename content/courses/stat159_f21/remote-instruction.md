## Goals of ConferZoom Session
Support your intake of information from the ISLE lessons by;
- Provide clarification (answer your question that came up during intake).
- Provide a new examples to help you assess your understanding.
- Provide interactive, hands-on personal experience with a concept to make it more familiar to you. 
- Provide additional learning checks through questioning.
- Provide opportunities to elaborate and consult with classmates.
- Review questions and student answers posed in the lesson.

## Student Advice for Successful Remote Learning
Being a remote learner is much different than being an in-person learner.  Much of the burden of learning get shifted to the student.  Presentation of class material is more difficult through a computer screen. Staying attentive and engaged is more challenging when no one is watching.  Speaking up and asking questions is more intimidating.  Connecting with your peers is tougher.  Finding a good quiet place to work and study can be challenging.  Therefore, you have to be more committed to your learning and be more proactive in getting help when you find yourself slipping.  Here are some tips for a more successful and enjoyable experience

## Proactively Seek Assistance and Clarification
Not being able to meet in-person, does put extra responsibilities on the student.  Normally, I would be able to walk around the classroom and check on everyone one-on-one.  Remotely, this is not very feasible.  **Therefore, if you have any questions and difficulties, you must be proactive and reach out to me or your peers.**  

### How do you do this? 
- ask questions during synchronous sessions (by speaking or using the Chatroom on [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/p/G5E21B7D9))
- post a **question** to everyone on our [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/p/G5E21B7D9)
- attend [student hours](/courses/stat159_s21/policies/#student-hours) 

## Importance of Preparation
Within each week's module, there are readings, videos and slides to view prior to our first ConferZoom session.  I will be assuming that you have done this work prior to the ConferZoom session.  **If you come to class unprepared, you are more likely to be overwhelmed and won't get as much out of your time.**  

Beyond just viewing the preparatory materials, you should begin **formulating and writing down questions** when you encounter something that you are finding difficult or confusing.  By indentifying challenging materials prior to class, **you are priming your nervous system** to be more ready to learn.  Since your question are written down, during class you can refer to them and more easily ask them.

## Make Connections with your Classmates
On the first day of class, I will be putting us into teams of 5.  We will be in these teams for the entire semester.  You will be supported and provided in-class time to work on and discuss assignments and projects with your team.   Having a group of classmates that you know and can freely reach out to will make class more enjoyable and you won't feel so on your own.  **I strongly suggest that you think of your team as your support network.**  I will support you in setting up virtual meetups through Canvas's Conferences (or a technological choose of your own) to work on and discuss the modules and projects.  Also, at times we will utilize randomized breakout rooms so you can meet and work with others beside just your team.

### Use of Team Roles 
We will try to use roles for team members.  These are "loose" roles - try to play the part, but also just try to work together.  If the roles work well, then great.  If they are causing issues or can be improved, please let's discuss strategies to improve the team structure.  Here are the initial roles;
