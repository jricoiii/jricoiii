## Attendance
Attending our virtual classes via Zoom is the greatest predictor of success in college.  I strongly encourage you to do everything possible to attend every class.  I will be recording each virtual session, but much of the in-class time will not be recorded since it is taking place in breakout rooms.  I see our classtime as an opportunity for interaction with your classmates and your instructor.  I will make efforts to use engaging activities during the virtual sessions to introduce ideas and allow you to establish a starting point for learning.  

## Participation
Being that we are remote, it is extremely difficult for me as your instructor to be able to "see" how you're doing during class.  We all need to put in our best effort to contribute to class by;
- volunteering to share screen to talk through a data analysis
- participating in polls
- speaking up if you are having difficulties following or simply have a question
- staying present during the entire class (treat ConferZoom as if you were actually sitting in class.)

We will be hopefully using breakout rooms often this semester. Based on the task, I will mix things up (i.e., one on one breakouts for think-pair-share, entire team of 8 breakouts, subteam breakouts of 4 members, random breakout groups of 4).  

The successful use of breakouts lies in the students' resposiblity (and the professor to make sure the use of breakouts is appropiate and timely).  Therefore, I am just sincerely asking all of you to take this class seriously and bring yourself fully engaged in the class process and be involved to the best of your ability.  Actually, I think we will all need to push ourselves and overcome our anxiety to be more vocal, since the remote environment can strongly pull us into our own little world where we just become observers.  Please fight the gravity of observance, instead **fly above** take an active role in our class.

## Question for Professors
Please use Campuswire for all communication. I am attempting to make this course an **email-free** course.

## Communication
I will be sending all communications out via Campuswire.  

## Student Hours
You've probably heard of *office hours*, I decided this is an outdated term (especially during Covid), so instead I am calling the time that I have set aside each week to help you as my **Student Hours**.  My students hours are listed in the table below.  Just send me a Direct Message through Campuswire and we can chat and figure if we need to have either a Zoom or ISLE session.  If this time do not work for you, send me a message explaining your situation and we will figure out alternative time to meet.

| Day of Week  | Time Available                 |
|--------------|--------------------------------|
| Monday       | 1:00 - 2:15   |
| Tuesday      | 1:00 - 2:15               |
| Wednesday    |  1:00 - 2:15   |
| Thursday     | 1:00 - 2:15                  |

## Technology
We will be meeting online in Canvas through Zoom. You will need a reliable internet connection and a device.  I recommend having an two monitors (i.e., connect your laptop to an external monitor) for the virtual classes, one monitor to observe the class and one monitor to use for your own work.  **If you need technology to be successful in a remote learning environment, you may submit an [Emergency Technology Equipment Request form](https://ohlone.formstack.com/forms/emergency_technology_equipment_request_form).  You can request a webcam, a wifi hotspot, or chromebook/laptop.  I am happy to assist you if needed.**

## Webcam
Having a webcam will allow for much better interaction between your classmates and instructors.  When I can not see who I am teaching, the experience is pretty draining and not enjoyable.  I will not require everyone to have their camera on, but I would like each of us to think about turning **ON** their webcam and see what it can do to **improve your learning experience**.  I understand that during class (especialy when the teacher is just talking), having the camera on all that time is a somewhat uncomfortable, but please realize that allowing me to see you improves my experience teaching and *possibly can improve the overall quality of the class*. 


## Accomodations
The Ohlone College’s Student Accessibility Services (SAS) is designed to open the doors to educational and occupational opportunities for students with disabilities. Our primary purpose is to provide an opportunity for all individuals to gain maximum benefit from their educational experience. Specialized services and educational accommodations are provided to students with disabilities to help them achieve their educational and vocational goals. If you require learning accommodations, please contact me as soon as possible or visit the Ohlone Student Accessibility Services (SAS) (formerly DSPS) [website](https://www.ohlone.edu/sas) for additional information and/or assistance.  All information and documentation is confidential.  **Please feel encouraged to make an appointment with me privately to discuss your specific learning needs in my class.**

## Academic Honesty
Academic dishonesty defrauds all those who depend upon the integrity of the College, its courses, and its degrees and certificates. Students are expected to follow the ethical standards required at Ohlone College.  Upon the first infraction of academic dishonesty; Student will receive zero grade on the assignment or exam and Academic Dishonesty Reporting Form is to be submitted to the Vice President, Student Services 

Violations of these standards are defined in the [Procedure on Academic Dishonesty](http://www.ohlone.edu/org/studentservices/academicdishonesty.html) 

## Tutoring
The Math Learning Center will be online through Zoom.  I will update as details become available to me.
