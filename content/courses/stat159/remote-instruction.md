## Student Advice for Successful Remote Learning
Being a remote learner is much different than being an in-person learner.  Much of the burden of learning get shifted to the student.  Presentation of class material is more difficult through a computer screen. Staying attentive and engaged is more challenging when no one is watching.  Speaking up and asking questions is more intimidating.  Connecting with your peers is tougher.  Finding a good quiet place to work and study can be challenging.  Therefore, you have to be more committed to your learning and be more proactive in getting help when you find yourself slipping.  Here are some tips for a more successful and enjoyable experience

## Proactively Seek Assistance and Clarification
Not being able to meet in-person, does put extra responsibilities on the student.  Normally, I would be able to walk around the classroom and check on everyone one-on-one.  Remotely, this is not very feasible.  **Therefore, if you have any questions and difficulties, you must be proactive and reach out to me or your peers.**  

### How do you do this? 
- ask questions during synchronous sessions (by speaking or using the Chatroom on [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/p/GC2A93A8D))
- post a **question** to everyone on our [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/p/GC2A93A8D)
- attend [student hours](/courses/stat159/policies/#student-hours) 

## Importance of Preparation
Within each week's module, there are readings, videos and slides to view prior to our first ConferZoom session.  I will be assuming that you have done this work prior to the ConferZoom session.  **If you come to class unprepared, you are more likely to be overwhelmed and won't get as much out of your time.**  

Beyond just viewing the preparatory materials, you should begin **formulating and writing down questions** when you encounter something that you are finding difficult or confusing.  By indentifying challenging materials prior to class, **you are priming your nervous system** to be more ready to learn.  Since your question are written down, during class you can refer to them and more easily ask them.

## Make Connections with your Classmates
On the first day of class, I will be putting us into groups of 4.  We will be in these groups for the first 6 weeks and you will complete your first project together as a team.  Also, we will utilize randomized breakout rooms at times so you can meet and work with others beside just your team.  Having a group of classmates that you know and can freely reach out to will make class more enjoyable and you won't feel so on your own.  You can even plan virtual meetups to work on the modules.
