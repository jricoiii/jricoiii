## Course Description
Math 159 Introduction to Statisitics is an introductory statistics course offered by the Math Department at Ohlone College.  This course assumes no prior exposure to statistics and there are no prerequisite courses.  There is very little algebra in the course.  Instead of teaching statistics through the mathematical language of equations and formulas, we will be mainly relying on statistical software to do all the calculations.  Therefore, our focus will be the explaining underlying concepts, writing interpretations of statistical analysis.
