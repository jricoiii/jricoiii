## Course Description
Math 159 Introduction to Statisitics is an introductory statistics course offered by the Math Department at Ohlone College.  This course assumes no prior exposure to statistics and there are no required prerequisite courses.  There is very little algebra in the course.  Instead of teaching statistics by relying on the mathematical language of equations and formulas, we will be focusing on the ideas and concepts.  When we need to do analysis and make calculations we will use a very friendly, easy to use statistical package called ISLE (Integrated Statistical Learning Environment).    

Therefore, we will have three areas of focus;
1. **explaining statistical concepts**
2. **conducting statistical investigations**
3. **writing interpretations of statistical analysis**.
