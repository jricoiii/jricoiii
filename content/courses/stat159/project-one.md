Cooperatively, we will be develop and adminster a survey to Ohlone College students.  The main topic addressed will be **The Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Ohlone College Students**.

## Phase I - Generate 
In your group;
- Develop a big picture (research topic) idea for what you want to learn about.
  - Suggested topics;
    - *mental well-being, physical well-being, employment, money insecurity, attitudes, behaviors, disruptions, new challenges*
- Post a **note** with your research topic in Campuswire under category `p1 - topic`

- Develop at least 4 questions for the survey. 
    - For each question identify/create a corresponding variable name, and categorize the variable as either a response or explanatory variable.
    - Post an **note** for each question/variable in Campuswire under categories `p1 - explanatory` and `p2 - response`

## Phase II - Vote 
Individually vote (liking the posted note) for your **top 5** variables for `p1 - explanatory` and `p1 - response post` (for a total of 10 variables)

## Phase III -  Survey 
I will create the survey from your questions with your input.  We will try to limit the survey to 20-40 questions.
Then we will distribute the survey to at least my three sections of statistics. (Hopefully, we can also distribute to some communication courses.)  After the surveys are completed, I will then provide a module with the data in a data explorer for your use.

## Phase IV - Analysis
Examine your data.  Calculate summary statistics for individual variables.  Examine relationships between your variables by building graphs and tables.

## Phase V - Report Findings
Develop a set of slides (Google Slides) or website (Google Sites)

Include the following;
### I. Introduction
Why did you choose this topic?  What did you expect to find?  Have similar studies been done elsewhere?  Why should the reader be interested in your results and continue reading?

### II.  Summary of Data Collection Methods 
How did you collect the data?  What were the observational units? What were your response and explanatory variables? What groups did you compare?   Did you have any problems with non-response or other unexpected results?  Did anything go wrong during the course of the study?  
 

### III.  Analysis of Results 
Describe any filters used.  Include appropriate numerical and graphical summaries of your data.  What relationships did you find? Write narratives explaining what you found in these data.   What conclusions can you draw? Make sure all figures and graphs are clearly labeled.
 

### IV. Conclusion 
Summarize the results of your study.  What did you learn?  Did the data behave as you expected?  Critique the methods used to collect the data.  Is there anything you would do differently next time?  How might this affect the conclusions of the study?  What similar questions might someone choose to investigate in the future to build on your results?
