## Description and Grading of Components  

### ISLE Modules
There are 10 ISLE modules that will serve as our main guides throughout the semester.  You will need to complete the entire module by submitting an answer to each question in the module for full credit.  The completion of the module earns **10 points**.  If not 100% complete, you will receive a percent of the 10. (e.g.,  75% complete would be 7.5 out of 10 )

#### Format of the Modules
- Page 1 - Learning Objective 
  - provides focus, attention
- Page 2 - Preparatory Work (*Intake Information*)
  - provides facts, terminology, introduction to ideas/concepts, learning checks
- Page 3 - Skill Demonstration (*Intake Information*)
  - provides examples, demonstration of tool, guided practice
- Page 4 - Skill Development (*Using Information, Building Skill*)
  - provides solo practice, reflection, discussion, modification, consultation 

### Skill Development 
In addition, each module will have a **Skill Development** page that provides instructions on an particular analysis to complete and write a report.  You will construct your report using Google Slides and [embed the slideshow](https://blogs.acu.edu/adamscenter/2020/04/19/embed-a-google-slides-presentation-in-canvas/) into the Canvas discussion for that module. 

#### Report Guidelines
Each report is a little different based on the skill being developed.  Be sure to understand what is being asked in each module's skill development.  Generally, each report wil have these components;
1. Introduction of the analysis
2. Description of how and what analysis was done
3. Summary statistics, graphics, tables and test results
4. Narrative including claims, explanation of evidence, interpretations and conclusions
5. Additional questions and/or concerns

#### Discussion Guidelines
First deadline is **Saturday at noon** for submission of your post (i.e., an embedded Google Slide Show).  Then, you will have until we meet for the first time the following week to have completed your discussion (e.g., if we have class for the first time on Tuesday at 11am, then your discussion should be completed by Tuesday at 11am).  

***
My minimum expectations for the discussion are; 
- everyone post a comment to each group member's post
- everyone respond to the comments the group made to your post

Comment with particular attention to;
- the accuracy of each person's table and graphics.
- the language, clarity, consistency and flow in their narratives
***

#### Discussions Drive Improvement
As a result of your participation in the discussion space;
- You will be able notice and resolve discrepancies and inconsistencies in statistical analyses.
- Improve clarity in the reporting of an analysis.
- Improve accuracy in conducting the analysis.

And hopefully, during the discussion you are able to see errors in your work or a better way to explain your findings. If so, please make changes to your report and embed the modified report (***tip***: *make a copy of the initial report, otherwise the initial slide show will change and you will lose your original report*) under your initial post. We will be developing a portfolio that includes each of your skill developments, so being diligent with an attitude towards continuous improvement of your reports will be of immense value when you work to clean up your portfolio for final submission at the conclusion of the semester.

#### Grading of Skill Development Report and Discussion 
Each report and discussion is worth a total of **10 points**. Late submissions will not accepted.  Your 2 lowest grades out of the 10 modules will be dropped.  So, if extenuating circumstances come up, missing up to 2 skill developments will not affect your grade.

**Grading Criteria**
- Posted on Time (Sat at Noon) -  2 pts
- Met Minimum Participation in Discussion - 2 pts
- Report completely address the task - 2 pts
- Report is accurate and clear - 3 pts
- Discussion was productive - 1 pt (this is based on the overall group's discussion)

### Projects
Each project will be worth 25 pts.  *Grading criteria for the project is still being developed. Details to be shared as soon as possible.*


### Portfolio
The final portfolio is a semester long effort, where you will build a website using Google Sites where each of your skill developments and projects will be housed.  At the end of the term, I will assess your semesters' work as a whole.  *Grading criteria for the portfolio is still being developed. Details to be shared as soon as possible.*
