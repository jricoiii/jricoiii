The basic statistical concepts and methods that we cover in the course have not changed  much in over 80 years. (Yes, this pre-dates modern computers. In fact much of modern statistics was developed in the later 1800's and early 1900's).  There is an abundance of learning materials covering introductory statistics (YouTube, websites, textbooks).  I recommend that you be proactive in seeking out information (Googling is a good strategy, if you know how to use the right key words).  I will be providing websites, YouTube videos, and open access (free) textbook as we progress through our learning modules.  Here are some places to start your journey into learning statistics.

## Integrated Statistic Learning Environment
Our primary learning space will be an online space called ISLE.  ISLE was developed by Carnegie Mellon University's Statistics and Data Science department with the goal of having an accessible interface for all to be data scientists.

Follow these steps to obtain access to ISLE.
1. You will need to sign up for ISLE with your Ohlone Student Email account (*Careful, you can sign up without using your Ohlone email, but later you won't be able to enroll in the course*)
    - [Sign Up for ISLE](https://isle.kymetis.com/dashboard/#/signup)
2. Click: **Go to Login page** and login with your email and password
3. Click on Menu. (Three Horizontal Bars in upper left corner to left of Open Your Courses)
4. Enroll will appear, click on it.
5. Select **RicoStatsF2020**.
6. Then select your section (*you might not know the section, but WebAdvisor has that section detail*)
7. You're in! 
8. Bookmark the [ISLE Website](https://isle.kymetis.com/dashboard)

## Recommended Reference Statistics Book
**OpenIntro Statistics** - published by the [OpenIntro](https://www.openintro.org/) team 
- Their mission is to make educational products that are free, transparent, and lower barriers to education. They also provide supporting resources, such as slides, videos, and more.)  

**This will be our primary resource**.  

The textbook (PDF) can be downloaded for free or contribution (**you can skip the optional contribution, by setting the price to $0**) at;  
[leanpub.com/openintro-statistics](https://leanpub.com/openintro-statistics)  

## Communication with Each Other and Professor
I have set up a course site at **Campuswire**, which will be our home base for communication.
- Sign up through this link at [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/p/GC2A93A8D), then verify your account by obtaining a verification code by checking your Ohlone email.


## Interactive Statistical Applets
The web has enabled a new set of resources to learn statistics through interaction called applets.    
- [ArtofStat Web Apps](http://www.artofstat.com/webapps.html)
- [StatKey](http://www.lock5stat.com/StatKey/)
- [Rossman/Chance Applet Collection](http://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/)
- [StatPREP Little Apps](https://ecstatic-mclean-a0b3e0.netlify.app/categories/little-app/)

## YouTube Channels
Here are some YouTube channels that I will be referencing in our modules.  If you find a channel that you really like and it is not listed here, please let me know so I can add it to the list.  
- [OpenIntroOrg](https://www.youtube.com/user/OpenIntroOrg/playlists)
- [STA 270: Applied Statistics](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC50DjGEiQZXUzj-A_ff9bkA/videos)
- [zedstatistics](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6AVa0vSrCpuskzGDDKz_EQ)

## Additional Textbooks
If you have access to an actual statistics textbook, you might find that quite useful.  An actual physical textbook is a great way to have the material at your fingertips.  Here are some other digital textbooks that I found and can recommend.
