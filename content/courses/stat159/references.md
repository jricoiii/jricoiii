## Note Regarding Learning Resources
The basic statistical concepts that we cover in the course have not changed in over 50 years. (Yes, most of them pre-date modern computers).  There is an abundance of learning materials covering introductory statistics (YouTube, websites, textbooks).  I recommend that you be proactive in seeking out information (googling is a good strategy, if you know how to use the right key words).  I will be providing websites, YouTube videos, and open access (free) textbook as we progress through our learning modules.  Here are some places to start your journey into learning statistics.

## Recommended Reference Statistics Book
OpenIntro Statistics - published by the [OpenIntro](https://www.openintro.org/) team (Their mission is to make educational products that are free, transparent, and lower barriers to education. We also feature supporting resources, such as slides, videos, and more.)  The textbook (PDF) can be downloaded for free or contribution (**you can skip the optional contribution, by setting the price to $0**) at;
