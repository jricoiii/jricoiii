## Big Picture Goal

I want everyone to find this course very accessible, approachable and ultimatelty worthwhile and enjoyable. (**Yes, I believe this course can be an enjoyable experience for everyone!**) To me, this means that regardless of your experience with statistics or mathematics you should be able to relate to the material and also be able to interact with the statistical software. I also want this course to be very straight-forward in terms of learning prompts and assignments.  

My main driving goal is for you to engage with the material and take the role of an statistical investigator.  You should develop your ability to communicate about topics, by making and supporting claims using statistical evidence.  Ultimately, this course is about enhancing your *voice* with new statistical language, concepts, and competencies.
