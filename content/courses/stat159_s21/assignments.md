## Description and Grading of Components  

### ISLE Modules
There are 7 ISLE modules that will serve as our main guides throughout the semester.  

To obtain full credit (12 points) for the module:  
- You need to attempt every question for 10 points
- If you don't complete the entire module, you will receive a proportion of 10 (e.g., 85% Completion Rate = 8.5 out of 10 points). You can see your percent complete by hovering over your name in the upper middle of the page.
- Provide reasonable, thoughtful responses to the questions. I will randomly choose "a representative question or two" that will be spot-checked for 2 points.

#### Format of the Modules
- **Page 1 - Learning Objectives**
  - provides focus, attention
- **Page 2 - Preparatory Work** (*Intake Information*)
  - provides facts, terminology, introduction to ideas/concepts, learning checks
- **Page 3 - Skill Demonstration** (*Intake Information*)
  - provides examples, demonstration of tool, guided practice
- **Page 4 - Group Discussion Prompts** (*Using Information, Building Skill*)
  - provides solo practice, reflection, discussion, modification, consultation 

### Group Discussion
In addition, each module will have a **Group Discussion Component** page that provides instructions on an particular analysis to complete and write a report.  You will construct your report using Google Slides and [embed the slideshow](https://blogs.acu.edu/adamscenter/2020/04/19/embed-a-google-slides-presentation-in-canvas/) into the Canvas discussion for that module. 


#### Discussion Guidelines
This discussion consists of three phases;

##### PHASE ONE :
Your own attempt (in the form of an embedded Google Slides) is due either Friday or Saturday. (depends on your section - check Canvas)

Details [here](https://ohlone.instructuremedia.com/embed/9991ac60-ecfb-4e09-a242-ed9f2075ad03) (go to end of video to see how to embed) -  

 

##### PHASE TWO:
As a group discuss your submissions and try to come to agreement on what your group wants to submit as a "final answer."  You can start this process as individual attempts are submitted.

 

##### PHASE THREE: 
A  group "final answer" submission is due the following week Tuesday or Wednesday at 10pm. (depends on your section - check Canvas)

 

##### GRADING:
You will get a grade for the discussion based on your participation and the correctness of the "final answers." To obtain full credit for the discussion;

- 5 pts for submitting your own attempt that is reasonable (3pts) and on time (2pts).
- 2 pts for thoughtful (1pt) participation (1pt) in the discussion.
- 3 pts for thoughtful/correctness/quality in the "final answer", everyone in the group gets these points.

#### Discussions Drive Improvement
As a result of your participation in the discussion space;
- You will be able notice and resolve discrepancies and inconsistencies in statistical analyses.
- Improve clarity in the reporting of an analysis.
- Improve accuracy in conducting the analysis.

And hopefully, during the discussion you are able to see errors in your work or a better way to explain your findings. If so, please make changes to your report and embed the modified report (***tip***: *make a copy of the initial report, otherwise the initial slide show will change and you will lose your original report*) under your initial post. We will be developing a portfolio that includes all of your works, so being diligent with an attitude towards continuous improvement of your reports will be of immense value when you work to clean up your portfolio for final submission at the conclusion of the semester.


### Projects
Each project will be worth 25 pts.  *Grading criteria for the project is still being developed. Details to be shared as soon as possible.*


### Portfolio
The final portfolio is a semester long effort, where you will build a website using Google Sites where each of your skill developments and projects will be housed.  At the end of the term, I will assess your semesters' work as a whole.  *Grading criteria for the portfolio is still being developed. Details to be shared as soon as possible.*
