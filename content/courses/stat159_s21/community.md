The class environment is most important to me, let me share my philosophy and thoughts on a learning community.

## Course Philosophy
I aspire to develop an inclusive learning community with a supportive culture for all students. My intention is to create a climate that allows my student to be empowered and in control of their learning.  Class time is an opportunity to engage with and collaboratively process statistical ideas.  This requires students to publicly share and explain their thinking and understanding.  My main role is to inquire into student thinking and provide support that promotes further development.  My ultimate aim is to provide an environment that allows my students the freedom and support to creatively explore statistical concepts.

## Learning Community
In our classroom, the strength of diversity and individual differences are respected, appreciated, and recognized as a source of strength.  Students are encouraged and expected to speak up and participate during class and to carefully and respectfully listen and respond to each other.  Any attitudes or actions that are destructive to the sense of community that we strive to create are not welcome and will not be tolerated.  


## Online Etiquette (aka Netiquette)
Often referred to as "netiquette," here is a gentle reminder of the interaction practices and rules we'll follow in all our interactions in this course.

If you ever feel that someone is not following these rules, please send an email to me using the Canvas Inbox and describe your concerns.
